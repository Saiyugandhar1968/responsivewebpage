          Education in India is a Concurrent List subject, that is both the
          Indian central government, and the state governments have
          responsibility for enacting and implementing education policy.[35] The
          central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the "10+2"
          pattern of education.[36]: 3  In this pattern, study of 10 years is
          done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges (Maharashtra) or Higher
          Secondary Schools(most other states),[36]: 44  and then 3 years of
          study for a bachelor's degree.[37] The first 10 years is further
          subdivided into 8 years of elementary education (5 years Primary
          School and 3 years Middle School), 2 years of Secondary education
          followed by 2 years of Higher Secondary Schools or Junior
          colleges.[36]: 5  This pattern originated from the recommendation of
          the Education Commission of 1964–66.[38] There are two types of
          educational institutions in India, 1) Recognized institutions –
          primary school, secondary school, special schools, intermediate
          schools, colleges and universities who follow courses as prescribed by
          universities or boards and are also open for inspection by these
          authorities , 2) Unrecognized Institutions, which do not ful It makes
          the curriculum related matters for school education across India.[46]
          The NCERT provides support, guidance and technical assistance to a
          number of schools in India and oversees many aspects of enforcement of
          education policies.[47] There are other curriculum bodies governing
          school education system specially at state level called SCERTs. State
          government boards of education: Most of the state governments have at
          least one "State board of secondary school education". However, some
          states like Andhra Pradesh have more than one. Also the union
          territories do not have a board. Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli,

          Policy Education policy is prepared by the Central Government and
          State Governments at national and state levels respectively. The
          National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, has provided for environment
          awareness, science and technology education, and introduction of
          traditional elements such as Yoga into the Indian secondary school
          system.[40] A significant feature of India's secondary school system
          is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the
          society.[citation needed] Professionals from established institutes
          are often called to support in vocational training. Another feature of
          India's secondary school system is its emphasis on profession based
          vocational training to help students attain skills for finding a
          vocation of his/her choosing.[41] A significant new feature has been
          the extension of SSA to secondary education in the form of the
          Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.[42] Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha
          Abhiyan (RMSA) which is the most recent initiative of Government of
          India to achieve the goal of universalisation of secondary education
          (USE). It is aimed at expanding and improving the standards of
          secondary education up to class X.It makes the curriculum related

          informal means.[44][45] School boards set the curriculum, conduct
          standardised exams mostly at 10th and 12th level to award the school
          diplomas. Exams at the remaining levels (also called standard, grade
          or class, denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the
          schools. National Council of Educational Research and Training

          varies from state to state and has more local appeal with examinations
          conducted in regional languages in addition to English – often
          considered less rigorous than national curricula such as CBSE or
          ICSE/ISC. Most of these conduct exams at 10th and 12th level, but some
          even at the 5th and 8th level. Central Board of Secondary Education
          (CBSE): The CBSE sets curriculum from Grades 9 to 12 for affiliated
          schools and conducts examinations at the 10th and 12th levels.
          Students studying the CBSE Curriculum take the All India Secondary
          School Examination (AISSE) at the end of grade 10 and All India Senior
          School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) at the end of grade 12.
          Examinations are offered in Hindi and English. Council for the Indian
          School Certificate Examinations (CISCE): CISCE sets curriculum from
          Grades 1 to 12 for affiliated schools and conducts three examinations,
          namely, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE –
          Class/Grade 10); The Indian School Certificate (ISC – Class/Grade 12)
          and the Certificate in Vocational Education (CVE – Class/Grade 12).
          CISCE English level has been compared to UK's A-Levels; this board
          offers more choices of subjects. CBSE exams at grade 10 and 12 have
          often been compared with ICSE and ISC examinations. ICSE is generally
          considered to be more rigorous than the CBSE AISSE (grade 10) but the
          CBSE AISSCE and ISC examinations are almost on par with each other in
          most subjects with ISC including a slightly more rigorous English
          examination than the CBSE 12th grade examination
